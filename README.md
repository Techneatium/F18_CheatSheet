# F/A-18C CHEATSHEET

## WHAT IS THIS?

- A kneeboard-style `cheatsheet` for the DCS F/A-18C
- Intended to allow someone already knowledgeable about the Hornet's systems to quickly find necessary information
- For ease of maintenance, only the PDF is available here. To convert this to a format directly suitable as an in-game kneeboard please use [DCS Kneeboard Builder](https://dcskneeboardbuilder.com/).

## HOW TO USE

- Just download the PDF and use as desired
- The remaining files are the LaTeX source code
